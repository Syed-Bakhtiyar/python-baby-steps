# Assignments can be done on more than one variable "simultaneously" on the same line like this

a, b = 3, 4



# Simple operators can be executed on numbers and strings:

one = 1
two = 2
three = one + two

hello = "hello"
world = "world"
helloworld = hello + " " + world


# Mixing operators between numbers and strings is not supported:

# This will not work!
#print one + two + hello
