# Basic Operators

# Arithmetic Operators

# Just as any other programming languages, the addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operators can be used with numbers.

number = 1 + 2 * 3 / 4.0

remainder = 11 % 3

squared = 7 ** 2

cubed = 2 ** 3



# Operators with Strings

# Python supports concatenating strings using the addition operator:
helloworld = "hello" + " " + "world"

# Python also supports multiplying strings to form a string with a repeating sequence:
lotsofhellos = "hello " * 10
print lotsofhellos



# Operators with Lists

# Lists can be joined with the addition operators:

even_numbers = [2,4,6,8]
odd_numbers = [1,3,5,7]
all_numbers = odd_numbers + even_numbers


# Just as in strings, Python supports forming new lists with a repeating sequence using the multiplication operator:

print [1,2,3] * 3
