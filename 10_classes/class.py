# Classes and Objects

# Objects are an encapsulation of variables and functions into a single entity. Objects get their variables and functions from classes. Classes are essentially a template to create your objects.

# A very basic class would look something like this:

class MyClass:
    variable = "blah"

    def function(self):
        print "This is a message inside the class."
	# print "This is varibale %s"%(variable)     # variable is not global


# class initialize
myobjectx = MyClass()

# calling function of the class
myobjectx.function()

# getting/access variable from that class
print myobjectx.variable
